This is just an example post to show you what can be done with Jekyll. Later on I will try to write an actual blog post about using `SwipeRefreshLayout` which was added to the support-v4 library.

### Using Jekyll

Jekyll is an ingenious tool for writing blogs. Not only it's not such a drag as wordpress, but also GitHub provides free hosting for your Jekyll page.

### Assets folder - without site.url

As you can in screenshot below:

<img class="center image" src="/assets/image.png"></img>

Or in this gif:

<img class="center image" src="/assets/cool.gif"></img>

Or you can simple download the file here:

<button class="download-button" onclick="window.location='/assets/ViewPagerBackgroundAnimation.apk';">
	<span class="icon"></span>
	<span class="title">Download apk</span>
</button>
